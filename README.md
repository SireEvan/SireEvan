Hi, Iâ€™m @SireEvan. I love python and is about medium level at it. Iâ€™m very interested in the python programming language (as you probably noticed) 
and game development. Iâ€™m currently learning python and trying to learn lua, html, and c++; which I learned are pretty difficult. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
programming with (only) friends!
